// 11. Using Node.js To Run JavaScript Code

/**
 * In this and many other sections, I'll occasionally run compiled code with Node.js - simply to save us the hassle of
 *
 * building a (demo) website that loads and executes that code.
 *
 * You can install the Node.js runtime from https://nodejs.org/en (it's available for all operating systems).
 *
 * This runtime allows you to run JavaScript code right on your system (via the node command) instead of requiring a
 *
 * website. So when you see me run node app.js (or some other file), that's me using Node.js to execute the code.
